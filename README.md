# BookAndAudio
Android Application that basically displays JPG files of a folder to the screen and plays an MP3.

# Problem to be solved
My neighbor has a lot of English learning books in scanned-in format and mp3, if the book also had a CD, on her computer.
She wanted her children to be able to read the books (and listen to the mp3) on her tablet. Unfortunately, it was quite inconvenient.
The app shows all the books in an overview with the cover of the book and the title. The user can select the book (s)he wants to read by tapping on the corresponding image/title.

# Convenience Factors
- Displaying the books as a selection in an overview with the book covers to be seen
- Putting two pages together as one image to get the feeling of an open book
- Ability to swipe to the next page
- Zooming in/out into the picture with intuitive gestures
